I'm a backend engineer. I enjoy working on distributed systems with varying
architectures and love Apache Kafka and gRPC. Most of my professional
experience is with Python, FastAPI, pytest, and asyncio. In my free time, I also
play with TypeScript, Go, and Zig. [Hire me](mailto:kysput@gmail.com).

Please check out [this cool library](https://ansipunk.github.io/based) I wrote
to asynchronously manage database connections.
